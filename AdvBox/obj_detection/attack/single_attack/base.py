class Metric(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for DNN robustness metrics.

    The :class:`Metric` class represents a robustness testing metric
    that searches for adversarial examples with minimum perturbation.
    It should be subclassed when implementing new metrics.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : a :class:`Model` instance
        The model that should be tested by the metric.
    criterion : a :class:`Criterion` instance
        The criterion that determines which images are adversarial.
    distance : a :class:`Distance` class
        The measure used to quantify similarity between images.
    threshold : float or :class:`Distance`
        If not None, the testing will stop as soon as the adversarial
        perturbation has a size smaller than this threshold. Can be
        an instance of the :class:`Distance` class passed to the distance
        argument, or a float assumed to have the same unit as the
        the given distance. If None, the test will simply minimize
        the distance as good as possible. Note that the threshold only
        influences early stopping of the test; the returned adversarial
        does not necessarily have smaller perturbation size than this
        threshold; the `reached_threshold()` method can be used to check
        if the threshold has been reached.

    Notes
    -----
    If a subclass overwrites the constructor, it should call the super
    constructor with args and kwargs.
